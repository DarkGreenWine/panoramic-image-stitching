# Panoramic-Mosaic-Stitching
CS766 Project 2
Image stitching is a technique to combine a set of images into a larger image by registering, warping, resampling and blending them together. A popular application of image stitching is to create panoramas. Generally speaking, there are two classes of methods for image stitching: direct methods and feature-based methods. An example of direct methods is Szeliski and Shum's SIGGRAPH 1997 paper (链接到外部网站。). Brown and Lowe's ICCV2003 paper, Recognising Panoramas (链接到外部网站。), is a cool example for feature-based methods.

In this project, we implemented a feature-based method to generate panoramic images.
